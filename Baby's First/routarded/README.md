# routarded  

## Instructions  

Wow, they forwarded http on a router with default creds?   

http://routarded_87f7837f50a5370771b9467d840c93c5.2014.shallweplayaga.me:5000/   

## Additional information  

The server http://routarded_87f7837f50a5370771b9467d840c93c5.2014.shallweplayaga.me:5000/ requires a username and password. The servers says: Login Required.  

Could not verify your access level for that URL. You have to login with proper credentials  

## pwn it!  
Default credentials? Is this a matter of figuring out what router this is?
