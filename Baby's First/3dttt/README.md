 (#) welcomes you to a friendly game of 3D Tic Tac Toe  

Since drawing 3D ASCII art is hard, you'll have to use your  
imagination to picture the game board below in 3D.  The z=0  
board is the side of the cube closest to you.  z=1 is in the middle  
and z=2 is the side farthest from you.  

The player with the MOST winning rows wins the round.  

Play well and play fast....

Strategy 1: play really fast??  
This didn't work.  Wrote solve.py to just brute-force every answer and have yet to win a puzzle.  This is going to take an algorightm that understands [how to win at tic tac toe](http://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Tic-Tac-Toe), but on a 3d level.  My thoughts are that this can be done by taking the middle space on the first table and whatever table the computer doesn't take and playing to win on those.
